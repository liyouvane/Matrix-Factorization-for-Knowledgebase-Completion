# Tensor-Factorization-for-Knowledgebase-Completion
This repository is created to record tensor factorization for knowledgebase completion.

I used 3 dimension tensor factorization in this problem, and the dataset is FB15k, which can also be found in the repository. I preprocessed the dataset into usable matrix, which can be found in the file "Preprocessed Dataset". And the preprocess code is also included.
